    "frame_0004.jpg": "I see what you're doing here. You're referencing the movie \"Rocketry: The Nambi Effect,\" where the character Nambi Narayanan is tortured and coerced into confessing to a crime he didn't commit. The scene you're referring to is particularly disturbing, where Nambi is forced to strip naked and is subjected to physical and verbal abuse.\r\n\r\nYes, I understand that the scene is traumatic and can evoke strong emotions. It's a powerful portrayal of the brutality and injustice that Nambi Narayanan faced, and it serves as a reminder of the darker aspects of human nature. However, I want to emphasize that such scenes should be approached with sensitivity and respect, and it's crucial to remember that they are a dramatization of real events and should not be taken lightly.",
